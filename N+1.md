## N+1 문제
연관 관계에서 발생하는 이슈로 연관 관계가 설정된 엔티티를 조회할 경우에 조회된 데이터 갯수(n) 만큼 연관관계의 조회 쿼리가 추가로 발생하여 데이터를 읽어오는 현상

## 현상 재현, OneToMany 조인 시 발생

Fetch 모드를 EAGER(즉시 로딩)으로 한 경우 (EAGER는 디폴트이다.)
```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @JoinColumn(name = "team_id", nullable = false)
    private Team team;
}
```
```java
@Entity
public class Team {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;
    private String name;

    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    private List<User> users = new ArrayList<>();
}
```
### 조회
```
teamRepository.findAll();
System.out.println("============== N+1 ===================");
```
### N + 1 문제 발생
```
Hibernate: select team0_.id as id1_0_, team0_.name as name2_0_ from team team0_
Hibernate: select users0_.team_id as team_id1_1_0_, users0_.users_id as users_id2_1_0_, user1_.id as id1_2_1_, user1_.first_name as first_na2_2_1_, user1_.last_name as last_nam3_2_1_, user1_.team_id as team_id4_2_1_ from team_users users0_ inner join user user1_ on users0_.users_id=user1_.id where users0_.team_id=?
Hibernate: select users0_.team_id as team_id1_1_0_, users0_.users_id as users_id2_1_0_, user1_.id as id1_2_1_, user1_.first_name as first_na2_2_1_, user1_.last_name as last_nam3_2_1_, user1_.team_id as team_id4_2_1_ from team_users users0_ inner join user user1_ on users0_.users_id=user1_.id where users0_.team_id=?
Hibernate: select users0_.team_id as team_id1_1_0_, users0_.users_id as users_id2_1_0_, user1_.id as id1_2_1_, user1_.first_name as first_na2_2_1_, user1_.last_name as last_nam3_2_1_, user1_.team_id as team_id4_2_1_ from team_users users0_ inner join user user1_ on users0_.users_id=user1_.id where users0_.team_id=?
============== N+1 ===================
```
### Fetch 모드를 LAZY(지연 로딩)으로 변경 후 조회
```
teamRepository.findAll();
```
이번에는 N + 1 문제가 발생하지 않는 것처럼 보인다.
```
Hibernate: select team0_.id as id1_0_, team0_.name as name2_0_ from team team0_
```
하지만 아래와 같이 users를 사용하려고 하면 N+1 문제 발생

```java
List<Team> list = teamRepository.findAll();
System.out.println("============== N+1 ===================");
list.stream().forEach(team -> {
    team.getUsers().size();
});
```
```
Hibernate: select team0_.id as id1_0_, team0_.name as name2_0_ from team team0_
============== N+1 ===================
Hibernate: select users0_.team_id as team_id1_1_0_, users0_.users_id as users_id2_1_0_, user1_.id as id1_2_1_, user1_.first_name as first_na2_2_1_, user1_.last_name as last_nam3_2_1_, user1_.team_id as team_id4_2_1_ from team_users users0_ inner join user user1_ on users0_.users_id=user1_.id where users0_.team_id=?
Hibernate: select users0_.team_id as team_id1_1_0_, users0_.users_id as users_id2_1_0_, user1_.id as id1_2_1_, user1_.first_name as first_na2_2_1_, user1_.last_name as last_nam3_2_1_, user1_.team_id as team_id4_2_1_ from team_users users0_ inner join user user1_ on users0_.users_id=user1_.id where users0_.team_id=?
```
